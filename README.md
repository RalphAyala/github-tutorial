There some things you will have to understand in order to use `GitHub` really well when making your repo on cloud9. There are some commands you will have to understand and learn that way you can always get the job done faster.

Here are some commands to begin with

First there is `git status` it let's you check to see if any changes you made are in order.
Then there is `git add` this let's you make any changes you can make to the current repo you are in.  
NOTE: You have to `cd` into that repo first to make that change it will not work if you do it in `workspace`.  
`git commit -m` will have you to create a message to the computer letting it know of what kind of changs you make to the repo.  
NOTE: You will have to be specific on what you did to the changes so the computer can understand what happened. For examble: `git commit -m "change title"`doing this will let the computer know of what change you made.
Lastly `git push` can put all of the changes you made on your repo to `github`then you can see what changes were made.
